### Adding New Algorithms or Examples

If you'd like to contribute a new algorithm or an example:

- Place new algorithm implementations or advanced examples in appropriate subdirectories (e.g., `algorithms/`, `examples/machine_learning/`).
- Ensure your code is well-commented and follows the project's coding standards.
- Include a `README.md` or a detailed documentation file in the `docs/examples/` directory for your contribution, explaining its purpose, dependencies, and how to run it. (Refer to `docs/examples/machine_learning/svm_classification.md` for an example of good documentation for a new ML script).
- Provide test cases if applicable (for core algorithm implementations).
- Add an entry to the main `README.md` under the 'Examples' or relevant section to make your contribution discoverable.
